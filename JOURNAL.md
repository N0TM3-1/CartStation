This is my journal of the design and building process of **CartStation**.

## 10/6/2025 - Set up the project  

I set up the GitHub repo as well as creating the KiCad project and finding and importing a footprint for the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, which I'm planning to use as the 'Brains' of the console. I also started searching for datasheets for the [**SST25VF512A** SPI Flash Chip](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/sst25vf512a), which I'm planning to use as the memory for the game cartridge, but decided not to include it in this journal log since it doesn't *really* fit in the 'Setting up the project' category.
Since there's not an image I can put that shows the project being set up, I'm just gonna put a screenshot of the RPi footprint.

## 10/8/2025 - Created Chip and Connector Footprints  

I created footprints and symbols for the **SPI Flash chip** as well as the connectors for the cartridge and the console. Took a while to find the dimensions I need to use, but I did it in the end. Took a bit longer than I'd imagined because I made them with the wrong dimensions at first so I had to redo them again. KiCad also played a role in this, because, for some reason, it wouldn't use settings I set up for the pads, so I had to manually change each one of them. But I did it in the end and I'm now ready to start working on the schematic itself. I'm planning to write a bit of documentation to figure out exactly what I want this console to be and what components I want to use, but that shouldn't take long.
