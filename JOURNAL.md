This is my journal of the design and building process of **Console (name TBA)**.

## 10/6/2025 - Set up the project  

I set up the GitHub repo as well as creating the KiCad project and finding and importing a footprint for the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, which I'm planning to use as the 'Brains' of the console. I also started searching for datasheets for the [**SST25VF512A** SPI Flash Chip](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/sst25vf512a), which I'm planning to use as the memory for the game cartridge, but decided not to include it in this journal log since it doesn't *really* fit in the 'Setting up the project' category.
Since there's not an image I can put that shows the project being set up, I'm just gonna put a screenshot of the RPi footprint.
